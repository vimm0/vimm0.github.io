## Topological Sorting: Easy to Hard Problems

### Easy

1. [**Course Schedule**](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/) *(Basic topological sort problem for detecting cycles and finding course order)*
2. [**Course Schedule II**](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-ii/) *(Finds an order to complete courses, leveraging topological sort)*
3. [**Find the Order of Characters in Alien Dictionary**](https://leetcode.com/problems/alien-dictionary/) *(Determines the order of characters based on sorting constraints)*
4. [**Minimum Height Trees**](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-height-trees/) *(Finds the root nodes of a tree that minimizes height, related to topological sorting)*
5. [**Reconstruct Itinerary**](https://leetcode.com/problems/reconstruct-itinerary/) *(Finds the order of flights, related to topological sort)*

### Medium

1. [**Task Scheduler**](https://leetcode.com/problems/task-scheduler/) *(Schedules tasks with cooldowns, related to ordering constraints)*
2. [**All Paths From Source to Target**](https://leetcode.com/problems/all-paths-from-source-to-target/) *(Finds all paths in a DAG, often solved using topological sort)*
3. [**Graph Valid Tree**](https://leetcode.com/problems/graph-valid-tree/) *(Validates if a graph can be a tree, involves topological sorting)*
4. [**Build Order**](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/graph-valid-tree/description) *(Determines the build order of projects based on dependencies)*
5. [**Longest Path in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-longest-path-directed-acyclic-graph/) *(Finds the longest path in a DAG, solved with topological sort)*

### Hard

1. [**Topological Sorting with Multiple Graphs**](https://www.codeforces.com/problemset/problem/558/B) *(Advanced topological sorting involving multiple graphs)*
2. [**Minimum Number of Operations to Make a Valid Sequence**](https://www.codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1352/E) *(Advanced problem with topological sort and sequence operations)*
3. [**Task Scheduling with Dependencies**](https://www.codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1030/C) *(Complex task scheduling involving topological sorting)*
4. [**Topological Sorting in Directed Graphs with Large Constraints**](https://www.codeforces.com/problemset/problem/379/C) *(Handles large graphs with topological sorting)*
5. [**Critical Connections in a Network**](https://leetcode.com/problems/critical-connections-in-a-network/) *(Involves advanced graph algorithms and topological sorting to find critical connections)*
