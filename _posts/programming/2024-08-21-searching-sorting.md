## Sorting and Searching: Easy to Hard Problems

### Easy

1. [**Binary Search**](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/) *(Basic binary search in a sorted array)*
2. [**Search Insert Position**](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/) *(Finds the position to insert an element in a sorted array)*
3. [**Merge Sorted Array**](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/) *(Merges two sorted arrays)*
4. [**First Bad Version**](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version/) *(Finds the first bad version in a range using binary search)*
5. [**Find Peak Element**](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/) *(Finds a peak element in an array using binary search)*

### Medium

1. [**Kth Largest Element in an Array**](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/) *(Finds the Kth largest element using sorting or heap)*
2. [**Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array**](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/) *(Finds the minimum element in a rotated sorted array)*
3. [**Search in Rotated Sorted Array**](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/) *(Searches for an element in a rotated sorted array)*
4. [**Top K Frequent Elements**](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/) *(Finds the K most frequent elements using sorting and heap)*
5. [**Median of Two Sorted Arrays**](https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/) *(Finds the median of two sorted arrays)*

### Hard

1. [**Largest Rectangle in Histogram**](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-rectangle-in-histogram/) *(Finds the largest rectangle in a histogram using stack-based approach)*
2. [**Trapping Rain Water**](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/) *(Calculates trapped water in an elevation map using two-pointer technique)*
3. [**Find K Pairs with Smallest Sums**](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-k-pairs-with-smallest-sums/) *(Finds K pairs with the smallest sums from two sorted arrays using heap)*
4. [**Median of Two Sorted Arrays**](https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/) *(Finds the median of two sorted arrays efficiently)*
5. [**Kth Largest Element in a Stream**](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-a-stream/) *(Keeps track of the Kth largest element in a stream of numbers)*
