2. [**Valid Sudoku**](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-sudoku/) *(Validates a Sudoku board)*
3. [**Flood Fill**](https://leetcode.com/problems/flood-fill/) *(Fills connected regions with a new color)*
4. [**Graph Valid Tree**](https://leetcode.com/problems/graph-valid-tree/) *(Checks if a given graph forms a valid tree)*
5. [**Shortest Path in Binary Matrix**](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-in-binary-matrix/) *(Finds the shortest path in a binary matrix from top-left to bottom-right)*

### Medium

1. [**Course Schedule**](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/) *(Determines if all courses can be finished given prerequisites)*
2. [**Minimum Height Trees**](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-height-trees/) *(Finds the roots of trees with the minimum height)*
