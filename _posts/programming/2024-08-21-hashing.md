## Hashing: Easy to Hard Problems

### Easy

1. [**Two Sum**](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) *(Finds two numbers that add up to a target using hashing)*
2. [**Contains Duplicate**](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/) *(Checks if a list contains duplicates using hashing)*
3. [**Single Number**](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/) *(Finds the single number in an array where every other number appears twice)*
4. [**Intersection of Two Arrays**](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-arrays/) *(Finds common elements between two arrays)*
5. [**Happy Number**](https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number/) *(Uses hashing to detect cycles in a sequence)*

### Medium

1. [**Group Anagrams**](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/) *(Groups anagrams together using hashing)*
2. [**Longest Consecutive Sequence**](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/) *(Finds the length of the longest consecutive sequence in an unsorted array)*
3. [**Find All Anagrams in a String**](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string/) *(Finds all anagrams of a pattern in a text using hashing)*
4. [**Subarray Sum Equals K**](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sum-equals-k/) *(Finds subarrays with a sum equal to a target using hashing)*
5. [**Contains Duplicate II**](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate-ii/) *(Checks if there are duplicates within a given range using hashing)*

### Hard

1. [**Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/) *(Finds the longest substring with unique characters using hashing)*
2. [**Sliding Window Maximum**](https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-maximum/) *(Finds the maximum value in a sliding window over an array)*
3. [**Design Twitter**](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-twitter/) *(Designs a Twitter-like system involving hashing for efficient access)*
4. [**Reconstruct Original Digits from English**](https://leetcode.com/problems/reconstruct-original-digits-from-english/) *(Decodes a string to reconstruct original digits using hashing)*
5. [**Minimum Window Substring**](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/) *(Finds the smallest window in a string that contains all characters of another string using hashing)*
