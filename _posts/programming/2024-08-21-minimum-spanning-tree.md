## Minimum Spanning Tree (MST): Easy to Hard Problems

### Easy

1. [**Kruskal’s Algorithm Implementation**](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-provinces/) *(Not directly MST but involves understanding of MST concepts)*
2. [**Union-Find Data Structure**](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/) *(Useful for Kruskal’s Algorithm)*
3. [**Graph Valid Tree**](https://leetcode.com/problems/graph-valid-tree/) *(Checks if a graph is a valid tree, which involves MST properties)*
4. [**Find the Redundant Connection**](https://leetcode.com/problems/redundant-connection/) *(Finds an edge that creates a cycle, relevant for MST understanding)*
5. [**Find the Town Judge**](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-town-judge/) *(Involves concepts of connectivity and component checking)*

### Medium

1. [**Minimum Spanning Tree**](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-spanning-tree/) *(Direct MST problem)*
2. [**Network Delay Time**](https://leetcode.com/problems/network-delay-time/) *(Involves finding shortest paths with MST concepts)*
3. [**Connecting Cities With Minimum Cost**](https://leetcode.com/problems/connecting-cities-with-minimum-cost/) *(Direct MST problem)*
4. [**Cheapest Flights Within K Stops**](https://leetcode.com/problems/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops/) *(Related to pathfinding and minimum costs, can be related to MST concepts)*
5. [**Kruskal’s Algorithm**](https://leetcode.com/problems/redundant-connection/) *(Classic problem for understanding MST algorithms)*

### Hard

1. [**Minimum Cost to Connect All Points**](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-to-connect-all-points/) *(Minimum spanning tree in 2D plane)*
2. [**Roads and Libraries**](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/roads-and-libraries/problem) *(MST problem with additional constraints)*
3. [**Minimum Spanning Tree (Generalized Problem)**](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/kruskals-algorithm/problem) *(Generalized MST problem with custom constraints)*
4. [**Find the Minimum Spanning Tree Weight**](https://www.codechef.com/problems/MST) *(Advanced MST problem with specific weight constraints)*
5. [**Optimal Network Design**](https://www.codeforces.com/problemset/problem/489/C) *(Complex network design problem involving MST concepts)*
6. [**Maximum Spanning Tree**](https://www.codeforces.com/problemset/problem/536/D) *(Variant of MST where the goal is to maximize the spanning tree weight)*
7. [**Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with MST Heuristic**](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-sum-of-an-hourglass/) *(Advanced problem involving MST heuristics for solving TSP)*
8. [**Advanced Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms**](https://www.codeforces.com/problemset/problem/817/E) *(Complex MST problem involving advanced algorithmic techniques)*
