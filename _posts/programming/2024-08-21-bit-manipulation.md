## Bit Manipulation: Easy to Hard Problems

### Easy

1. [**Single Number**](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/) *(Finds the single number in an array where every other number appears twice)*
2. [**Number of 1 Bits**](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/) *(Counts the number of 1 bits in a binary representation of a number)*
3. [**Power of Two**](https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-two/) *(Checks if a number is a power of two)*
4. [**Reverse Bits**](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-bits/) *(Reverses the bits of a 32-bit unsigned integer)*
5. [**Hamming Distance**](https://leetcode.com/problems/hamming-distance/) *(Calculates the Hamming distance between two integers)*
6. [**Missing Number**](https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/) *(Finds the missing number in a range using XOR)*
7. [**Single Number II**](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-ii/) *(Finds the single number that appears once when others appear thrice)*
8. [**Find the Duplicate Number**](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/) *(Finds the duplicate number in an array using bit manipulation

### Medium (continued)

3. [**Find the Duplicate Number**](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/) *(Finds the duplicate number in an array using bit manipulation)*
4. [**Bitwise AND of Numbers Range**](https://leetcode.com/problems/bitwise-and-of-numbers-range/) *(Finds the bitwise AND of numbers in a given range)*
5. [**Total Hamming Distance**](https://leetcode.com/problems/total-hamming-distance/) *(Calculates the total Hamming distance between all pairs of numbers in an array)*

### Hard

1. [**Maximum XOR of Two Numbers in an Array**](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-xor-of-two-numbers-in-an-array/) *(Finds the maximum XOR of any two numbers in an array)*
2. [**Find Minimum XOR Sum of Two Arrays**](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-xor-sum-of-two-arrays/) *(Finds the minimum XOR sum of two arrays by pairing elements)*
3. [**Subsets with Bit Manipulation**](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/) *(Generates all possible subsets using bit manipulation)*
4. [**Longest Substring with At Most Two Distinct Characters**](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-with-at-most-two-distinct-characters/) *(Finds the longest substring with at most two distinct characters using bit manipulation)*
5. [**Minimum Number of Flips to Convert Binary Matrix to Zero Matrix**](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-flips-to-convert-binary-matrix-to-zero-matrix/) *(Finds the minimum number of flips required to convert a binary matrix to a zero matrix)*
