## Basic Concepts to Master in Competitive Programming

Competitive programming requires a strong foundation in algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques. Below are the key concepts you need to master to excel in competitive programming.

### 1. Data Structures

Understanding and implementing various data structures is crucial for solving problems efficiently.

- **Arrays and Strings**: Basic operations, traversals, and manipulations.
- **Linked Lists**: Single, double, circular lists, and operations like insertion and deletion.
- **Stacks and Queues**: LIFO and FIFO principles, use cases like expression evaluation and scheduling.
- **Trees**:
  - **Binary Trees**: Traversals (in-order, pre-order, post-order), height, and diameter.
  - **Binary Search Trees (BST)**: Insertion, deletion, search, and balancing (AVL trees).
  - **Heaps**: Min-heap, max-heap, and priority queues.
  - **Trie**: Efficient information retrieval, especially useful for problems involving strings.
- **Graphs**:
  - **Representation**: Adjacency matrix, adjacency list.
  - **Traversal algorithms**: BFS, DFS.
  - **Shortest path algorithms**: Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall.
  - **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**: Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms.
  - **Topological Sorting**: Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) processing.
- **Hashing**: Hash tables, collision resolution techniques.
- **Disjoint Set (Union-Find)**: Efficiently manage and merge sets, useful in MST and connectivity problems.

- **Binary Search on Answer**: Problems where you need to minimize/maximize a value under constraints.
- **Meet in the Middle**: Divide the problem space to reduce time complexity.
- **Greedy vs. DP**: Understanding when a greedy approach is optimal and when DP is required.

### 5. Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: Analyze the running time of algorithms using Big O notation.
- **Space Complexity**: Analyze memory usage, optimizing for both time and space.
- **Amortized Analysis**: Understand average time per operation over a sequence of operations.

### 6. Practice Problem Solving

- **Pattern Recognition**: Learn to recognize problem patterns (e.g., knapsack problems, shortest path problems).
- **Handling Edge Cases**: Always consider edge cases, including smallest and largest inputs, empty inputs, and unexpected values.
