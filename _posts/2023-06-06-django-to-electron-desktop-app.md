Django application is python-based web framework that follows the model–template–views architectural pattern. This contain server which respond to client's request but django application need to start application from command prompt which need some technical knowledge. 

Some clients may find scary to write command in command prompt. So to reduce the friction between application and user, we created an application in electron so that end-user could open their application in one-click.
