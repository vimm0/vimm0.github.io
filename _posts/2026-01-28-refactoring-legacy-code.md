Refactoring is an essential part of the software development lifecycle. It involves restructuring existing computer code—changing the factoring—without changing its external behavior.

### Why Refactor?

1.  **maintainability**: Clean code is easier to understand and modify.
2.  **Extensibility**: Identify patterns and abstractions that make it easier to add new features.
3.  **Bug Reduction**: Cleaning up code often reveals hidden bugs.

### When to Refactor?

-   **Rule of Three**: When you do something for the third time, refactor.
-   **Code Smells**: When you notice "smells" like large classes, long methods, or duplicated code.
-   **Before Adding Features**: Make it easier to add the feature by cleaning up the code first.

Refactoring requires a good suite of automated tests to ensure that you haven't broken anything while cleaning up. Happy coding!
