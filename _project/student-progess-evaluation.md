- The web-enabled software for tracking records of each student and predicting their progress is a project aimed at improving the educational experience for both students and teachers.
- The system will be built using modern web technologies such as Python, pandas, and Django.


The platform will provide a centralized and automated system for tracking the records of each student, including attendance, grades, and other relevant data. It will also include predictive analytics features to forecast student performance and identify potential areas of concern.
