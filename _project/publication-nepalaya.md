The e-commerce platform will allow users to browse, search, and purchase books from the comfort of their homes. The platform will feature a user-friendly interface, advanced search functionality, and a recommendation engine based on user preferences and history. Users will be able to view book details, add them to their cart, and complete the purchase using secure payment methods.
